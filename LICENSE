This code is AS-IS , you break your stuff that is your fault not any of the project authors.

As for rights? The concepts here are obvious to anyone with a brain and thus not patentable.  That said, your free to use it under the MIT liscence. I do reserve the right to withdraw any rights granted in the future should I choose to do so.
